## Overview

**Basketball 3D Pro** is a fully-featured 3D basketball game that runs in the browser via a Node.js server. The game features an NBA-accurate court, realistic ball physics, professional-quality visuals, and an immersive arena atmosphere.

The project was built as a demonstration of advanced Three.js capabilities combined with a completely custom physics engine, implementing all physics calculations manually without any external physics libraries.

## Physics Engine

The custom physics engine (`PhysicsEngine.js`) implements:

### Core Equations

**Projectile Motion** (from the physics report):
```
v₀ = √(g·x² / (2·cos²θ·(x·tanθ - Δy)))
```
Where:
- `g` = 9.81 m/s² × world scale
- `x` = horizontal distance to hoop
- `θ` = launch angle (46°–52° based on distance)
- `Δy` = height difference

**Optimal Launch Angle**:
- Close range (<5m): 52°
- Mid range: 50°
- Long range (>15m): 46°
- Free throw: 51° (as per report)

**Magnus Effect** (backspin):
```
F_magnus = k × (ω × v)
```
Backspin improves accuracy by creating slight upward force, as documented in the physics report.

**Coefficient of Restitution**:
- Floor: 0.72 (NBA regulation ball bounces to 72-76% of drop height)
- Backboard: 0.65
- Rim: 0.55

**Air Resistance**:
```
F_drag = 0.5 × ρ × Cd × A × v²
```
Where `ρ = 1.225 kg/m³`, `Cd = 0.47` (sphere), `A = π × r²`

### Integration Method
Uses **Verlet-style integration** with fixed timestep (1/120s) and accumulator for stability, with up to 4 substeps per frame.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** v16.0.0 or higher
- **npm** (comes with Node.js)

### Steps

```bash
# 1. Clone or extract the project
cd basketball3d

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Start the server
npm start
```

---

## Running the Game

After running `npm start`, open your browser and navigate to:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

The game will load automatically. Click **PLAY GAME** to start a full match or **FREE PRACTICE** for unlimited shooting.

### Development Mode
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Game Controls

| Key / Input | Action |
|-------------|--------|
| `W` / `↑` | Move Forward |
| `S` / `↓` | Move Backward |
| `A` / `←` | Move Left |
| `D` / `→` | Move Right |
| `Shift` | Sprint |
| `Hold Left Mouse Button` | Charge Shot Power |
| `Release Left Mouse Button` | Shoot Ball |
| `Mouse Move` | Aim Direction (camera look) |
| `R` | Reset Ball to Player |
| `C` | Cycle Camera Mode |
| `M` | Toggle Mute |
| `Escape` | Pause / Menu |

### Shot Tips
- The **green zone** on the power meter is the sweet spot for optimal shots
- Hold longer for more power (needed for 3-pointers from distance)
- The **trajectory preview** dots show where the ball will go
- **Backspin** is automatically applied to improve accuracy
